"# reminder_app_py" 

brainstorming notes for a reminder app in python

When I run the app, what happens first?

  A nice little motivational logo like 📈💸 and a minimalist interface
  they user should have there choice of actions that they can perform:

    1. Set a reminder/ add a lesson or a new mindset
    2. View reminders/mindsets
    3. Delete a reminder/ upgrade or change a mindset
    4. when and what time the reminder should trigger as per the user's choice
    5. Exit

How often should reminders trigger?

  user choice: hourly,daily, weekly, monthly, custom

Where are reminders stored?

   database or local file (json,txt,csv) 
   //yet to be decided

What happens if I miss one?

  may be a punishment or some kinda reward system getting removed 

How does motivation change?

  day by day the goals and mindsets should evolve and turn into disciplines rather than a mere reminder/motivation.
